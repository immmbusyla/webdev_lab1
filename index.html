	  <h1>Welcome to my first website!</h1>
	  <p>Hello, my name is Jian Liang. I'm majoring in Business and ITM, and this isn't my first time programming. However, I often find myself learning a language and then forgetting it the next time I need to use it.</p>
	  
	  <div class="hobby"> 
		<p>In my free time, I enjoy:</p>
	  <ol>
		<li>Editing videos and trying to improve my skills.</li>
		<li>Gaming, particularly MOBAs.</li>
		<li>Watching crime and mystery shows, as well as medical dramas. One of my favorite shows is <a href="https://tubitv.com/series/300009726/big-white-duel" target="_blank">Big White Duel</a>.</li>
		<li>Traveling and exploring new countries.</li>
	  </ol>

	  <p>Thank you for your time!</p>
